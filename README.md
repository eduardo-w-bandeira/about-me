# About Me

I am interested in perfect systems, which leads me to be interested in:
- The triune nature of God, because it's the perfect system.
- Python language, because its syntax and structure are close to what I consider ideal.
- Ido language, because its syntax and structure are close to what I consider ideal.
- English language, because, among natural languages, it has a relatively simple syntax and structure.
- Lightweight Markup Languages, because they aim to create a perfect system using LEGO-like pieces made from ASCII characters.
